      "Thank you for the detailed response! Based on your specifications, we can create a market risk library in Python that includes functions for:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Value at Risk (VaR)**: This will compute the potential loss in value of an asset or portfolio over a defined period for a given confidence interval.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Expected Shortfall (ES)**: This will measure the average loss that occurs beyond the VaR threshold.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Risk Metrics**: This can include additional measures like standard deviation, beta, and correlation, which help to assess the risk profile of an asset or portfolio.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Next Steps\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's start by creating a basic structure for your market risk library with the following functions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **`calculate_var`**: This function will compute VaR for a given set of returns and a confidence level.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **`calculate_expected_shortfall`**: This function will compute the Expected Shortfall based on the VaR.\n",

      "3. **`risk_metrics`**: This will compute various risk metrics, such as volatility and correlation.\n",

      "### Explanation\n",
      "- The `MarketRiskLibrary` class is initialized with a pandas Series of returns.\n",
      "- The `calculate_var` method computes the VaR by calculating the specified quantile of the returns.\n",
      "- The `calculate_expected_shortfall` method calculates the average of the losses that exceed the VaR threshold.\n",
      "- The `risk_metrics` method returns the mean return and volatility of the returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example Usage\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's how you could use this library:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Example: Creating a MarketRiskLibrary instance and using its methods\n",
      "\n",
      "# Generate some random returns\n",
      "np.random.seed(42)\n",
      "returns_data = np.random.normal(0, 0.01, 1000)  # Simulating daily returns\n",
      "returns_series = pd.Series(returns_data)\n",
      "\n",
      "# Create an instance of the MarketRiskLibrary\n",
      "risk_library = MarketRiskLibrary(returns_series)\n",
      "\n",
      "# Calculate VaR and Expected Shortfall\n",
      "var_value = risk_library.calculate_var(confidence_level=0.95)\n",
      "expected_shortfall = risk_library.calculate_expected_shortfall(confidence_level=0.95)\n",
      "metrics = risk_library.risk_metrics()\n",
      "\n",
      "print(f\"Value at Risk (VaR): {var_value}\")\n",
      "print(f\"Expected Shortfall (ES): {expected_shortfall}\")\n",
      "print(f\"Risk Metrics: {metrics}\")\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### How to Run the Code\n",
      "1. First, ensure you have `pandas` and `numpy` installed:\n",
      "   ```\n",

      "\n",
      "2. Then run the provided code in a Python environment (like Jupyter Notebook or any IDE).\n",
